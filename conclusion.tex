\label{sec:conclusion}
Technology and religion and their mutual influences will continue to be a point of contention in the scholarly world. The profound impacts both have in our lives cannot be underestimated, and more than ever, the COVID-19 pandemic has made these impacts more evident. Since humans started writing and documenting the world around them, we have come to see how, through history, technology has influenced how humans go about one of their most intimate activities: practicing their faith. There is sufficient evidence that the internet has changed how believers worship, pray, give, and fellowship. From online streaming of services to online prayer chats, religion online is here to stay for better or worse. If done right, with privacy in mind, the internet can be a powerful tool for religious organizations to continue to share the message of love, peace, and joy, creating ever-expanding communities of like-minded individuals. Religion online, as another product of consumption perse, is merely a byproduct of the producer/consumer relationship of the internet. The sudden increase in religious offerings available to believers on the internet gave believers choices regarding where to tune in to exercise their faith. Its influences in the lives of believers are worth exploring.
